The church of <b>San Carlo Borromeo </b>(also known as <i>San Carlo
al Porto </i>) in Via del Porto has a very troubled architectural
history, marked by continuous evolutions and almost total destruction
during the Second World War.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>1. The
origins: From the &quot;Crocetta&quot; to the seventeenth century</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Initially, in
that place there stood a Marian image called <b>Santa Maria del
Paradiso </b>, placed next to a cross (hence the ancient name of the
area, &quot;la Crocetta&quot;).</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>1466: </b>The
	Confraternity of Santa Maria del Paradiso was founded and built its
	first church.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>1612-1619:
	The Confraternity changes its name in honor of Saint Charles
	Borromeo. In 1619, the foundation stone of a new church, designed by
	the architect Nicolò Barelli , </b>is laid . This building was
	consecrated in 1644.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>2. The
eighteenth-century expansion</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">During the 18th
century, the church underwent major works to adapt to the Baroque
taste and the growing needs of the brotherhood:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>1720-1728:
	</b>The side chapels dedicated to St. Anthony and the Blessed Virgin
	are added.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>1746: </b>The
	structures were raised and equipped with vaults, giving the church a
	majestic appearance that it would maintain until the 20th century.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>3. Destruction
and modern reconstruction</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The most dramatic
moment in the building's history was <b>January 29, 1944. </b>A
violent Allied bombing raid hit the port area and the nearby station
hard, almost razing the church and the archiepiscopal seminary to the
ground.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The
	&quot;Miracle&quot; of the Oratory: </b>While the church was almost
	entirely destroyed, the <b>Oratory of San Carlo </b>(built in 1667
	on the upper floor and adjacent to the church) remained incredibly
	intact. This event was considered miraculous by the faithful, who
	attributed it to the intercession of Saint Anthony of Padua (who
	lived in a nearby convent).</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The
	current building: </b>The church we see today is a post-war
	reconstruction (completed in the 1950s based on a design by <b>Alfredo
	Cosentino </b>). It is a modern building, a &quot;parallelepiped&quot;
	with clean lines and covered in marble, which contrasts sharply with
	the Baroque style of the surviving oratory next door.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>In short: what
to see today</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Today the complex
is an architectural &quot;hybrid&quot;:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The New
	Church: </b>Functional, modern, typical of post-war architecture.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The Oratory
(17th century): </b>Accessible through the church, it is a perfectly
preserved baroque jewel, with a richly frescoed vault depicting St.
Charles in glory.</p>
