The church of <b>San Carlo Borromeo </b>(also known as <i>San Carlo
al Porto </i>) in Via del Porto has a very troubled architectural
history, marked by continuous evolutions and almost total destruction
during the Second World War.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>1. The
origins: From the &quot;Crocetta&quot; to the seventeenth century</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Initially, in
that place there stood a Marian image called <b>Santa Maria del
Paradiso </b>, placed next to a cross (hence the ancient name of the
area, &quot;la Crocetta&quot;).</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>1466: </b>The
	Confraternity of Santa Maria del Paradiso was founded and built its
	first church.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>1612-1619:
	The Confraternity changes its name in honor of Saint Charles
	Borromeo. In 1619, the foundation stone of a new church, designed by
	the architect Nicolò Barelli , </b>is laid . This building was
	consecrated in 1644.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>2. The
eighteenth-century expansion</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">During the 18th
century, the church underwent major works to adapt to the Baroque
taste and the growing needs of the brotherhood:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>1720-1728:
	</b>The side chapels dedicated to St. Anthony and the Blessed Virgin
	are added.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>1746: </b>The
	structures were raised and equipped with vaults, giving the church a
	majestic appearance that it would maintain until the 20th century.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>3. Destruction
and modern reconstruction</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The most dramatic
moment in the building's history was <b>January 29, 1944. </b>A
violent Allied bombing raid hit the port area and the nearby station
hard, almost razing the church and the archiepiscopal seminary to the
ground.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The
	&quot;Miracle&quot; of the Oratory: </b>While the church was almost
	entirely destroyed, the <b>Oratory of San Carlo </b>(built in 1667
	on the upper floor and adjacent to the church) remained incredibly
	intact. This event was considered miraculous by the faithful, who
	attributed it to the intercession of Saint Anthony of Padua (who
	lived in a nearby convent).</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The
	current building: </b>The church we see today is a post-war
	reconstruction (completed in the 1950s based on a design by <b>Alfredo
	Cosentino </b>). It is a modern building, a &quot;parallelepiped&quot;
	with clean lines and covered in marble, which contrasts sharply with
	the Baroque style of the surviving oratory next door.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>In short: what
to see today</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Today the complex
is an architectural &quot;hybrid&quot;:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The New
	Church: </b>Functional, modern, typical of post-war architecture.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The Oratory
(17th century): </b>Accessible through the church, it is a perfectly
preserved baroque jewel, with a richly frescoed vault depicting St.
Charles in glory.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">This church <b>was
actually declared unsafe </b>following the May 2012 earthquake.
Although it did not collapse like the one in the Ferrara area, it
suffered structural damage that compromised its safety for worship.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The current
state (2026)</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Yes, your
information is substantially correct regarding regular use:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Extended
	closure: </b>After 2012, the church remained closed for extended
	periods. Parish activities and Masses were transferred for years to
	the nearby parish of <b>San Benedetto </b>(on Via Indipendenza).</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The
	Oratory: </b>The adjacent Baroque Oratory, which had miraculously
	escaped the bombings of 1944, has also undergone inspections and
	restoration. In recent years, several safety and conservation
	interventions have been carried out to allow its reopening, at least
	for specific events or guided tours.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Accessibility
	today: </b>Although the building has undergone consolidation work,
	the church has not resumed its full daily parish function as it once
	did, often remaining closed to the public or open only on special
	occasions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Interestingly,
</b>due to its hybrid nature (a modern church built on an ancient
oratory), the anti-seismic consolidation work was particularly
complex, as it had to protect the post-war concrete structure without
damaging the precious frescoed ceiling of the 17th-century oratory.</p>
