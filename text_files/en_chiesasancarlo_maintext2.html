<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">This church <b>was
actually declared unsafe </b>following the May 2012 earthquake.
Although it did not collapse like the one in the Ferrara area, it
suffered structural damage that compromised its safety for worship.</p>

state (2026)</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Yes, your
information is substantially correct regarding regular use:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Extended
	closure: </b>After 2012, the church remained closed for extended
	periods. Parish activities and Masses were transferred for years to
	the nearby parish of <b>San Benedetto </b>(on Via Indipendenza).</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The
	Oratory: </b>The adjacent Baroque Oratory, which had miraculously
	escaped the bombings of 1944, has also undergone inspections and
	restoration. In recent years, several safety and conservation
	interventions have been carried out to allow its reopening, at least
	for specific events or guided tours.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Accessibility
	today: </b>Although the building has undergone consolidation work,
	the church has not resumed its full daily parish function as it once
	did, often remaining closed to the public or open only on special
	occasions.</p></li>
