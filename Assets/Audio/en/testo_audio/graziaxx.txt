Welcome! You stand before the Marian Plague, a silent yet powerful memorial. Today we retrace the historical drama that led to its creation: the great Plague of 1630 that devastated Bologna."

The terrible epidemic, part of the larger "Manzonian Plague" that struck Northern Italy, reached Bologna in May 1630. It was carried by Landsknecht soldiers en route to the siege of Mantua, and unfortunately spread rapidly, surpassing the efforts of Cardinal Legate "Bernardino Spada" and the Senate to stem the contagion.

The consequences were catastrophic: between May and December 1630, the city claimed over "13,300 victims" out of approximately 61,500 inhabitants. Including the surrounding countryside, it is estimated that the Bolognese territory lost approximately "40,000 people". The city suffered a demographic collapse, losing almost half its population and suffering severe social repercussions.

The fight against the epidemic was closely led by Cardinal Spada, who organized assistance in the lazarettos set up outside Porta Santo Stefano and in Castelfranco, relying on the tireless work of the Camillian religious.

As a testimony to faith and in thanksgiving for the end of the plague, art and devotion left an indelible mark. In addition to commemorative plaques like this one, the famous "Plague Altarpiece" was commissioned from Guido Reni in 1630, and a precious votive canopy was created.
This plaque, and the many memorials scattered throughout the city, remind us of the immense sacrifice of those months. We invite you now to silently observe this sign of memory and hope."
